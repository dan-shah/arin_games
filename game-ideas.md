# Game Ideas

Educational game ideas for kids, focused on reading and STEM.

## Reading & Language

### 1. Word Builder Bakery 🧁
Run a bakery where customers order treats by showing a picture. Drag letter cookies onto a tray to spell the word. Start with 3-letter words, progress to longer ones. Correct spelling = happy customer animation!

### 2. Rhyme Time Train 🚂
A train picks up animal passengers, but they can only board if you match them with rhyming words. "Cat needs a friend that rhymes!" - pick from hat, dog, mat. Build the longest rhyme train!

### 3. Story Builder Rocket 🚀
Choose a character, setting, and problem to launch a rocket. The game reads aloud a short story using your choices. Teaches narrative structure (beginning, middle, end).

### 4. Sight Word Ninja 🥷
Sight words float across the screen as bubbles. Hear a word spoken, then slash/tap the matching word before it escapes. Track how many words mastered.

## Math & Logic

### 5. Fraction Pizza Shop 🍕
Customers order fractions of pizza ("I want 1/2 pepperoni!"). Drag toppings onto the correct portion. Visual way to learn halves, quarters, thirds.

### 6. Pattern Planet 🪐
Aliens communicate in patterns. Complete the sequence (shapes, colors, numbers) to decode their message and help them. Each planet has different pattern types.

### 7. Measurement Treehouse 🌳
Build a treehouse by measuring boards with a ruler. "Cut a board 5 inches long!" Teaches inches, centimeters, and comparing lengths.

## Science & Engineering

### 8. Circuit Bug 🔌
Guide a lightning bug through mazes by completing simple circuits. Connect wires, batteries, and bulbs to light the path. Introduces basic electricity concepts.

### 9. Weather Forecaster 🌦️
Run a weather station! Learn to read thermometers, identify cloud types, and predict weather. Dress characters appropriately for the forecast you make.

### 10. Plant Lab 🌱
Grow plants by giving them the right amounts of sun, water, and soil. Experiment to discover what each plant needs. Time-lapse shows growth. Teaches plant biology basics.

### 11. Rocket Engineer 🛠️
Build rockets by selecting nose cones, body sizes, and fins. Launch and see how design affects flight. Introduces basic physics (weight, drag, thrust).

### 12. Body Builder Hospital 🏥
Patients come in and you place organs/bones in the right spots on an X-ray outline. Learn where the heart, lungs, stomach, and bones belong.

## Coding & Problem Solving

### 13. Robot Chef 🤖
Program a robot to make recipes by dragging command blocks (move, grab, pour, stir). Teaches sequencing and basic programming logic. Debug when the robot makes mistakes!

### 14. Maze Coder 🐭
Help a mouse reach cheese by writing simple arrow commands (↑↑→↓→). Plan the whole route before running it. Introduces algorithms and debugging.

### 15. Bridge Builder 🌉
Animals need to cross rivers. Build bridges using limited shapes (triangles, rectangles). Test if it holds - teaches basic structural engineering and geometry.
